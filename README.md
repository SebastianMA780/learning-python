# Learning Python Repository

Welcome to my **Learning Python** repository! üìòüêç

## Purpose
This repo is my personal collection of Python knowledge‚Äîkind of like a digital notebook. The main goal is to keep everything I've learned about Python organized in one place so I can easily refer back to it whenever I need to.

Whether it's syntax, tips, tricks, or examples, you'll find them here.

## What's Inside
- **Notes** - Concepts, explanations, and key takeaways.
- **Code Examples** - Practical examples and snippets for quick reference.
- **References** - Links and resources that I found helpful.

## Why This Repo?
I wanted a simple way to store and access everything I've learned about Python without losing track of important details. Over time, it will grow as I keep learning and experimenting.
