# Variables are used to store data values in Python. A variable is created the moment 
# you first assign a value to it and is assigned using the assignment operator (=) and the name. You cant use reserved keywords as variable names.


name = "python"
print(name)

# You can overwrite the value of a variable , remember python is organized from top to bottom and left to right in execution
name = "python 3"
print(name)

#underscores are allowed in variable names
_name = "python new"
print(_name)
